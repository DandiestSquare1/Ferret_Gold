## Programming is the art of learning
 - It's not about knowing X or Y
 - Specific technologies and concepts are picked up whenever the current task/project requires them
 - People who talk about math or other specific skills are not professional programmers and talk out of their asses.
 - Most coders don't need advanced math but if they need it for a project, they have the ability to learn quickly and deal with the task at hand
